# Data-Structures-Implementations
This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure that stores data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
It follows the property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value,
and the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value.
### Implementation
* File: `BinarySearchTree.java`

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements,
where each element points to both the next and the previous element.
### Implementation
* File: `DLinkedList.java`

## Graph
A graph is a versatile data structure used to represent relationships between entities. 
It consists of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between vertices).
### Implementation
* File: `Graph.java`

## Hashtable
A hashtable, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
It provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of values based on their keys.
### Implementation
* File: `Hashtable.java`

## Dynamic Array
A dynamic array is a resizable array that automatically increases or decreases in size as elements are added or removed.
### Implementation
* File: `MyArray.java`

## Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
It is used for tasks like task scheduling, breadth-first search, etc.
### Implementation
* File: `Queue.java`

## Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
It is used in various applications, including function call management, expression evaluation, and more.
### Implementation
* File: `Stack.java`
